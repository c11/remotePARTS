The goal of remoteSTAR is to ...

## Description

`remoteSTAR` is currently in early development. Organization is less than ideal,
official unit tests are not present, and C++ code has occasionally exhibited 
bugs. 

This package is not stable, consider it a beta. Please report any comments or 
bugs either directly to me `morrow5@wisc.edu` or through github: 
https://github.com/morrowcj/remoteSTAR (it is a private repo so please send
me a github username and I'll add you to the repo). 

**Note** I plan to eventually show examples of importing rasters. Here is a lovely 
resource for manipulating rasters in R, including how to convert them
to data frames: [Geospatial raster with R data carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/)

## Installation

Currently to install this package, the best way is to install with the 
`remoteSTAR_[version].tar.gz` file created with `R CMD check`. 

Once a user has the tar.gz file they can install it with

```
install.packages("remoteSTAR_[version].tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

and then from the R console with load it with

```
library(remoteSTAR)
```

<!-- Eventually, the following lines should replace the above installation info: -->

<!-- You can install the released version of remoteSTAR from 
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("remoteSTAR") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("morrowcj/remoteSTAR") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Example usage

For examples on how to use `remoteSTAR` in it's current state, see the `Alaska`
vignette by using the following R code:

```
vignette("Alaska")
```

## Planned Features / To-do

Since this package in developmental stages, there are many features that are
currently unimplemented. This section will keep track of the features and design
implementations that I plan to include or change in the next version as well. 

* [ ] allow users to, optionally, input parameters (e.g. `r` and `a` in the 
exponential-power function) instead of fitting ML parameters. 

* [ ] add example for testing "is there an overall time trend" to the vignette

* [ ] make providing distance matrix **optional** instead of required for 
`fitGLS.partition_rcpp()` and the partitioned method as a whole. (**note** 
this has been demonstrated in the vignette but has not yet been turned into
a function)

* [ ] include parallelization and distributed comptuting options. If these are
not natively implemented (i.e. using openMP in C++), then examples of how to
make it work with other parallelization tools should be provided. 

* [ ] more explicit handling of missing data: "How should a constant time series
be treated?"; "What happends if there is a missing data point within a single 
time series?"

* [ ] possibly change the CLS function so that it reads 1 line of data at a time
to save memory. Also, using `RcppEigen::fastLM()` may be better than `lm()` in 
terms of speed. 

* [ ] **Break up C++ functions into more than 1 file**

* [ ] **WRITE TESTS FOR EVERY FUNCTION!!!**

* [ ] update documentation for every function to include output format
and example usage. 

* [ ] replace `fitGLS` with `fitGLS2` code and change the way all other C++ 
functions handle lists. The C++ code in `fitGLS2` modifies an existing list
made in R rather than building one within the C++ code. 

* [ ] create S3 constructors and methods (i.e. `print()`, `summary()`, etc.) for
all functions

  - [x] `remoteGLS()` constructs a GLS object and `print.remoteGLS()`
  prints a compact and summarized display.

  - [x] `remoteCLS()` constructor and methods for CLS objects. Both the
  pixel-level `fitCLS` and the map-level `fitCLS.map` have S3 methods. 
  
  - [ ] `remoteAR()` constructor and methods for AR_REML objects
  
  - [ ] `PARTmat()`: partition matrix for the partitioned GLS method.
  
If there are any additional features that you would like to see implemented, or
bugs/issues that you ran into, please submit an issue on github. 

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(remoteSTAR) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
