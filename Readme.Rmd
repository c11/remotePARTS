## Description

`remoteSTAR` is currently in early development. Organization is less than ideal,
official unit tests are not present, and C++ code has occasionally exhibited 
bugs. 

This package is not stable, consider it a beta. Please report any comments or 
bugs either directly to me `morrow5@wisc.edu` or through github: 
https://github.com/morrowcj/remoteSTAR (it is a private repo so please send
me a github username and I'll add you to the repo). 

## Installation

Currently to install this package, the best way is to install with the 
`remoteSTAR_[version].tar.gz` file created with `R CMD check`. 

Once a user has the tar.gz file they can install it with

```
install.packages("remoteSTAR_[version].tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

and then load it with

```
library(remoteSTAR)
```

from the R console. 

## Example usage

For examples on how to use `remoteSTAR` in it's current state, see the `Alaska`
vignette by using the following R code:

```
vignette(remoteSTAR)
```
