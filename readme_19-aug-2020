When trying to 'check' and build this package I am getting 0 errors.
However, the check fails and exits with status 1 because of 3 warnings and 
2 notes. 

# Warnings:

1) "undocumented code objects" - because I have yet to add documentation to
any of the code, I'm getting this warning

2) "disallowed file types in data/" - apparently ONLY .RData files are 
allowed in the data/ directory

3) "not fully portable file names" - files in the 'original-example*/'
folder have names with spaces that the build tools don't like.

# Notes:

1) package size: I don't know what's wrong here. 
"installed size is 27.9Mb
sub-directories of 1Mb or more: 
data 25.5Mb 
libs 2.3Mb"

2) "non-standard top-level files" - it doesn't like that I have ANY files
that aren't expressly expected in a package: code, data-raw,
example_Rpackage, etc. 


# Conclusion

It seems that I need to remove anything that is not going to be necessary for
the package in the remoteSTAR directory and reformat a few things. 

It should be noted, however, that the "Install and Restart" functionallity 
worked perfectly well and the package is usable locally.
